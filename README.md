This is Mozilla's fork of the [re:dash](https://redash.io) dashboarding
software. This fork contains customizations and changes driven by Mozilla's
internal requirements. You almost certainly don't want to use this code, but
instead would be better served by the [officially supported
repository](https://github.com/getredash/redash/).

Mozilla is working with the re:dash maintainer and puts considerable effort
into contributing generally useful improvements and bug fixes back to the
upstream project.
